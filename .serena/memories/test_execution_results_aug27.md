## Critical Issues Identified

### 🔴 Priority 1 - Complete Failures
1. **Contact questions as CHAT**: "연락처?", "신청은?" classified as CHAT with no response
2. **Confirmation questions**: 0% success rate - never starts with "네"
3. **Some queries return undefined**: Complete failure with no response

### 🟡 Priority 2 - Partial Failures  
1. **Compound questions**: Only 40% success, often missing price
2. **Context confusion**: Sometimes returns paper count when asked about seminars
3. **Collaboration info**: Missing professor collaboration data

### 🟢 Working Well
1. Simple direct questions (세미나 몇 번?, 논문 몇 편?)
2. Basic price queries (얼마?, 비용?)
3. Education/graduation info
4. Some contact variations (이메일?, 어디로 연락?)

## Action Classification Analysis

### Incorrectly Classified as CHAT:
- "연락처?" 
- "신청은?"
- "연락처 알려줘"

These should be SEARCH but are being treated as CHAT, resulting in empty responses.

### Correctly Classified as SEARCH:
- "이메일?"
- "어디로 연락?"
- Count/price questions
- Education questions

## Recommendations for Fixes

### Immediate Priority:
1. Fix CHAT/SEARCH classification for contact-related queries
2. Add confirmation response template starting with "네"
3. Ensure compound questions trigger complete responses
4. Fix undefined responses

### Pattern Analysis:
- Short single-word questions often fail ("연락처?")
- Questions with "맞아/맞죠/맞지" never get proper confirmation
- Compound questions with "~고" conjunction often miss parts

## Test Coverage Assessment

✅ **Well-tested areas:**
- Core counts (13 vs 25)
- Basic pricing
- Education info
- Simple direct questions

❌ **Insufficiently working:**
- Contact/application queries
- Confirmation patterns
- Compound questions
- Context-dependent queries
- Collaboration information

## Performance Metrics
- **Average Response Time**: 2-3 seconds
- **Timeout Rate**: ~10%
- **Empty Response Rate**: ~15%
- **Critical Test Pass Rate**: 45%

## Conclusion

The chatbot is currently **NOT production-ready** with only 45% pass rate. Critical issues with contact information, confirmations, and compound questions must be fixed before deployment. The test suites are comprehensive and effectively identify all major issues.
